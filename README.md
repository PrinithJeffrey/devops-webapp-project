# DevOps Web Application Project

## Overview
This project is a simple Node.js and Express web application, automated for CI/CD deployment using Docker, GitHub Actions, Docker Hub, and Render (free tier, no credit card required). It’s designed to demonstrate a full DevOps workflow with infrastructure-as-code and configuration management scaffolding.

## Features
- Node.js + Express backend (easy to extend to MERN)
- Containerization using Docker
- Infrastructure provisioning with Terraform (optional/enhanced)
- Configuration management using Ansible (optional/enhanced)
- Automated CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Free cloud hosting on Render
- Docker images stored on Docker Hub

## CI/CD Workflow

1. **Version Control:** Track all code changes in GitHub.
2. **Build and Push Docker Image:** Automatic Docker image build and push to Docker Hub with every push to main.
3. **Deployment:** Image is deployed to Render and started as a live web service.
4. **(Optional) Infrastructure & Config**: Terraform and Ansible files are provided for future infrastructure and configuration automation.

## Live Demo

Once deployed, your application will be live at:

```
https://devops-app.onrender.com
```
*(Actual Render URL will differ)*

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Edit and extend the app (Node.js/Express)**
3. **Push changes to the `main` branch**
4. **Watch CI/CD pipeline build and deploy automatically**
5. **Visit the Render URL for the running application**
